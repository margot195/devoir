<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>Internship at Young&Rubicam, a creative agency who focuses on the client relationship and his experience. It was the first step into the world of communication, and it impacted me a lot. I participated in some client's projects (for example : Audi or Fifa World Cup). I cam to love the process between a client's wish and his idea to the realisation and the making-of.</p>
